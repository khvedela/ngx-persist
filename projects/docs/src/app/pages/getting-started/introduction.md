**NgxPersist** is a type-safe, signal-based persistent state primitive for Angular.

Manage your application state with the power of Angular Signals, automatically synced with `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or any custom backend. `ngx-persist` provides a seamless developer experience with full TypeScript support, making state persistence trivial in modern Angular applications.

## Features

*   🚀 **Signal-based**: Built specifically for modern Angular (19+) using the Signals primitive.
*   🔒 **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript inference and support for your state objects.
*   🔌 **Pluggable Adapters**: Comes with `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` support out of the box. Easily extensible for IndexedDB or async storage.
*   ⚙️ **Configurable**: Global prefixes, custom serializers, and parsers to fit your needs.
*   ⚡ **Lightweight**: Zero dependencies other than Angular itself.
